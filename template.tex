\section*{Solution to Question 1}

Explain your solution here. If you want to use mathematical equations, you have
to enclose them in dollar-signs. For example, Pythagoream is $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.
If you want show a display equation, use double-dollar signs. For example, roots
of a quadratic equation are
$$
x_{1,2} = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \: .
$$

Empty line marks the beginning of a new paragraph. Use paragraphs to separate
arguments of your solution. If a question has multiple parts, split your
solutions in to separate subsections.
